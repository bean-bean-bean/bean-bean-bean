- 👋 Hi, I’m Ben， I'm from the UK, and I live in Shanghai, China!

- 👀 I’m interested in blockchain and cryptocurrencies, travel, and health and fitness.

- 🌱 I’m currently taking part in a remote full-stack web development bootcamp with Le Wagon, and will be learning how to use a number of languages to build cool applications.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything which is going to help me to learn!

- 📫 You can reach me on WeChat @bbaldieri, or telegram at @BeanyBeany!
